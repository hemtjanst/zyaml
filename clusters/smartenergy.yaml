  #0x000D DailyConsumptionTarget uint24 0x000000 to 0xFFFFFF R - O
  DailyConsumptionTarget: &dailyConsumptionTarget

    name: Daily Consumption Target
    type: u24
    description: |
      is a daily target consumption amount that can be displayed to the consumer on a HAN device, with the intent that
      it can be used to compare to actual daily consumption (e.g. compare to the CurrentDayConsumptionDelivered).
      This may be sent from the utility to the ESI, or it may be derived. Although intended to be based on Block
      Thresholds, it can be used for other targets not related to blocks. The formatting will be based on the
      HistoricalConsumptionFormatting attribute.
      Example: If based on a Block Threshold, the DailyConsumptionTarget could be calculated based on the
      number of days specified in the Block Tariff Period and a given Block Threshold as follows:
      DailyConsumptionTarget = BlockNThreshold / ((BlockPeriodDuration /60) / 24). Example: If the target is
      based on a Block1Threshold of 675kWh and where 43200 BlockThresholdPeriod is the number of minutes in
      the billing period (30 days), the ConsumptionDailyTarget would be 675 / ((43200 / 60) / 24) = 22.5 kWh per day

    description: |
      is an 8-bit Enumeration which indicates the currently active block. If blocks are active then the current
      active block is based on the CurrentBlockPeriodConsumptionDelivered and the block thresholds.
      Block 1 is active when the value of CurrentBlockPeriodConsumptionDelivered is less than Block1Threshold value;
      Block 2 is active when CurrentBlockPeriodConsumptionDelivered is greater than Block1Threshold value and less than
      Block2Threshold value, and so on. Block 16 is active when the value of CurrentBlockPeriodConsumptionDelivered is
      greater than Block15Threshold value.

      does not appear in an attribute set. This represents the duration of each interval. ProfileIntervalPeriod
      represents the interval or time frame used to capture metered Energy, Gas, and Water consumption for profiling purposes.
