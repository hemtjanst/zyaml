      represents the Sensirion AG measurement of VOC status relative to the sensors recent history.
      The VOC Index uses a moving average over the past 24 hours (called the "learning time") as offset.
      The VOC Index mimics the human noseâ€™s perception of odors with a relative intensity compared to recent history.
      A VOC Index above 100 means that there are more VOCs compared to the average (e.g., induced by a VOC event from
      cooking, cleaning, breathing, etc.) while a VOC Index below 100 means that there are fewer VOCs compared to the
      average (e.g., induced by fresh air from an open window, using an air purifier, etc.).
      The VOC Index ranges from 1 to 500.
